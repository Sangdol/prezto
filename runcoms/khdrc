# NOTE(koekeishiya): A bind is written in the form:
#                   <keysym> [!] [<app list>] [->] : <command>
#                   where
#                       <keysym>   = mode + mod + ... + mod - literal
#                       <keysym>   = mode + mod + ... + mod - keycode (must have 0x prefix)
#                       <keysym>   = mode + mod + ... + mod (modifier only binding)
#
#                       [<app,
#                         app,     = optional list '[app1, ..., appN]' of applications
#                         app>]      that this bind will be activated for. if the
#                                    focused application is not contained in this list,
#                                    the associated command will not be triggered, and
#                                    the keypress will be passed through as normal.
#
#                       [!]        = optional operator '!' negates the behaviour when a
#                                    list of applications is given. this marks the bind
#                                    as 'Hotkey_Exclude', causing the bind to not work
#                                    when the focused application is in the given list.
#
#                       [->]       = optional operator '->' that marks this bind as
#                                    'passthrough'. this causes the key to be passed
#                                    through to the system, instead of being consumed.
#
#                       <command>  = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
#                                    follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
#                                    variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
#                                    when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
#                                    to chain commands.
#
#                                    to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
#                                    prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.
#
#                                    an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.
